        <p>
            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red
            junglefowl of
            Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others
            are
            kept as pets or for cockfighting.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most
            breeds,
            and the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to
            allow
            them to fly more than a short distance.[19] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult
            chickens
            of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on
            either
            side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a
            mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[20]

        <h2>Reproduction and life-cycle</h2>
        <p>To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often
            lowering
            the wing which is closest to the hen.[32] The dance triggers a response in the hen[32] and when she responds
            to
            his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in
            which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs
            off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the
            male does a tail-bending display.[33]
