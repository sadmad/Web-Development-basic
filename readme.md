## Introduction

Welcome to my Web Development Review repository! After spending some years away from web development, I felt the need to catch up with the latest trends, technologies, and best practices in this ever-evolving field. This repository serves as a personal learning journey and a resource for others who might be in the same situation.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

1. To document my journey as I review and relearn web development.
2. To provide a structured and comprehensive resource for others who need to catch up on web development.
3. To showcase progress and learning through practical examples and projects.
