      The Persians or Iranian Persians (/ˈpɜːrʒənz/ PUR-zhənz or /ˈpɜːrʃənz/
      PUR-shənz) are an Iranian ethnic group who comprise over half of the
      population of Iran.[4] They share a common cultural system and are native
      speakers of the Persian language[6][7][8] as well as of the languages that
      are closely related to Persian.[9]

    <h2>Ethnonym</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The term Persian, meaning "from Persia", derives from Latin Persia, itself
      deriving from Greek Persís (Περσίς),[24] a Hellenized form of Old Persian
      Pārsa (𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿), which evolves into Fārs (فارس) in modern Persian.[25] In the
      Bible, particularly in the books of Daniel, Esther, Ezra, and Nehemya, it
      is given as Pārās (פָּרָס). A Greek folk etymology connected the name to
      Perseus, a legendary character in Greek mythology. Herodotus recounts this
      story,[26] devising a foreign son, Perses, from whom the Persians took the
      name. Apparently, the Persians themselves knew the story,[27] as Xerxes I
      tried to use it to suborn the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but
      ultimately failed to do so.

    <h3>History of usage</h3>
    <p>
      Although Persis (Persia proper) was only one of the provinces of ancient
      Iran,[28] varieties of this term (e.g., Persia) were adopted through Greek
      sources and used as an exonym for all of the Persian Empire for many
      years.[29] Thus, especially in the Western world, the names Persia and
      Persian came to refer to all of Iran and its subjects.[29][10]

    <h2>History</h2><hr/>
    <p>
      Persia is first attested in Assyrian sources from the third millennium BC
      in the Old Assyrian form Parahše, designating a region belonging to the
      Sumerians. The name of this region was adopted by a nomadic ancient
      Iranian people who migrated to the region in the west and southwest of
      Lake Urmia, eventually becoming known as "the Persians".[10][38] The
      ninth-century BC Neo-Assyrian inscription of the Black Obelisk of
      Shalmaneser III, found at Nimrud, gives it in the Late Assyrian forms
      Parsua and Parsumaš as a region and a people located in the Zagros
      Mountains, the latter likely having migrated southward and transferred the
      name of the region with them to what would become Persis (Persia proper,
      i.e., modern-day Fars), and that is considered to be the earliest
      attestation to the ancient Persian people.[39][40][41][42][43]
